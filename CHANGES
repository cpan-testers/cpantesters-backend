Changelog for CPAN-Testers-Backend

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Added]

    - Added CPAN::Testers::Backend::Fix::TesterNoname to fix testers who
      appear with `"NONAME"` in the test report list.

    - Added CPAN::Testers::Backend::ViewMetabaseCache to view legacy
      metabase cache entries to see how they differ from the actual test
      report (and to see if they can be parsed at all).

    - Added Rex task to disable a backend machine in case of
      decommissioning.

    [Fixed]

    - Updated Minion::Backend::mysql dependency to finally work
      correctly with Minion v7 and Minion v8

    [Fixed]

    - Updated Beam::Minion to v0.007, which allows one worker to be used
      for all containers (instead of one per container).
    - Updated to Minion 8 which includes a new Admin UI
    - Fixed unprocessed report detection to work in pages instead of all at
      once.

    [Added]

    - Added new test report processing script,
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::ProcessReports (thanks @jberger!)
    - Added Minion job processing system via Beam::Minion
    - Added migration for metabase cache:
      CPAN::Testers::Backend::Migrate::MetabaseCache
    - Added logging to our container files. Now all processes in the
      backend get logged to STDERR (and syslog, though our syslog is not
      configured to put those logs anywhere useful).
